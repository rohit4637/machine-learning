    "- The sinking of the RMS Titanic in the early morning of __15 April 1912, four days into the ship's maiden voyage__ from __Southampton to New York City__, was one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history, __killing__ more \n",
    "than **1,500 people**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an __estimated 2,224 people on board__ when she struck an __iceberg in the North Atlantic__. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The ship had received __six warnings__ of sea ice but was travelling at near __maximum speed when the lookouts sighted the iceberg__. \n",

    "- __Unable to turn quickly enough__, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled the starboard (right) side and opened __five of sixteen compartments to the sea__. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The disaster caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the __unequal treatment__ of the three passenger classes __during the evacuation__. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the __International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (1914)__, which continues to govern maritime safety.\n",

    "### 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "- On __April 15, 1912__, the largest passenger liner ever made collided with an __iceberg__ during her maiden voyage. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When the __Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew__.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This __sensational__ tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for **ships**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the reasons that the **shipwreck** resulted in such loss of life was that there were **not enough lifeboats** for the passengers and crew. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others such as **women, children, and the upper-class.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/Term-2/master/images/anigif_sub-buzz-2417-1580340238-6.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" /></center>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **`titanic.csv`** file contains data for **891** of the real Titanic passengers. \n",
    "  - Each row represents one person. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived, their age, their ticket-class, their sex and the fare they paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of this analysis is to analyse the data set, explore it answering related questions using data visualization and statistical methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are also some questions we would like to answer with Titanic dataset analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - What is passengers demographic structure analyzed in terms of attributes?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - What is the overall passengers survival ratio?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Which groups have higher chances for survival?"

    "- We also make use of __pandas profiling__ feature to generate an html report containing all the information of the various features present in the dataset.\n",
    "- We have seen the impact of columns like _Age, Embarked, Fare, SibSp and Parch_ on the rate of survival.\n",
    "- The most important inference drawn from all this analysis is, we get to know what are the __features on which survival is highly positively and negatively correlated with.__ \n",
    "- This analysis will help us to choose which __machine learning model__ we can apply to predict survival of test dataset. "
